# Rest Countries

This project is a solution to Frontend Mentor's `REST Countries API with color theme switcher` challenge. This involves REST API and best practices in fetching data. This is built with ReactJS and Redux. This is a responsive application and also has dark mode which showcased my layout and css architectural skills.

Here are the complete set of tools that I used for building this app:

- SASS/SCSS (css pre-processor)
- React (front-end JS library)
- Redux (state management)
- Redux Thunk (middleware)
- React Router (routing)
- Create React App aka CRA (tooling)
